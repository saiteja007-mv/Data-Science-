It starts assigning the values to all your values in your partition. You. irrespective of anything, it does not. It does not matter, even if the value is changing. 1 is there, first is there. One is there. 100 is there. One is there. 200 is there. Second value, second value, fourth value. Now, this is going to be fixed value. It is, again, 123. Now, is it going to be the fourth value? 1212 I understood about how row number one. So now what? For what? Can you use this? Anyway, you will have a serial number here, right? So what does this serial number do? 12345678910 to 111213. So this is basically maybe to get to know the maximum, maximum of this is going to be the number of items that are there. Is that right? The maxiOne use of that row number, and then maybe you can also identify, like, maybe, yeah, number of purchases would be there, maximum of that. All of that row number would be useful. Clear. Now, we have another function rank. So here comes a tricky part. Rank, what do you think should happen? I will arrange it according to the. according to you, it gives one rank to 100. Second rank to 207 to 300 420 right? So here is. for which we ordered by. So again, 4321 43212. For which we ordered for which column we ordered by. It will give the rank for that column based on that column So based on this, the ranking should be one, 234 is what you say. What do you say? What do you say? 400. 400. 400. Second. So you agreed with what Samika told you. First. 400. 200. What do you think? I think it may be calculate the amount in provision. It gives the ranks to the roads. So
